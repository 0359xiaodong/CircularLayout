Circular Layout
==============

A scrollable circular layout for android where you can add items, customize the radius, the number of items displayed at a time 
and the X and Y offset of the layout. Moreover, you can control how the items are rendered when scrolling the layout. There are two modes Pinned and Fixed. 

I have uploaded a sample app that uses this library. In this app you can customize the circualr layout using set of seek bars.
A direct link for the sample app:

The following are photos for the sample app. You can see how the circular layout changes according to the values of the seek bars.
